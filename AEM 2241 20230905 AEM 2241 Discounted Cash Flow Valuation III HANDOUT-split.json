This is either paid in full\nin a lump sum, or - more commonly - refinanced using\nanother bullet loan.\nLoan Types\nFixed, 25%, 5yrs\nFixed, 10%, 5yrs\nFixed, 10%, 30yrs\nVar, 25%, 5yrs\nVar, 10%, 5yrs\nVar, 10%, 30yrs\nAmortization Tables\n•\nFor a regular (i.e., non-bullet) loan, the ending balance of the\nprincipal should be 0 (if we ignore rounding errors).\n•\nIt is possible to write formulas that directly provide the values\nin a loan’s amortization table. For example, consider the\nbeginning balance of a variable-payment loan with principal\nPV\n, interest rate\nr\n, and maturity\nt\n, in year\nk\n:\nBB\n=\nt\n−\nk\n+\n1\nt\nPV\n(1\n≤\nk\n≤\nt\n)\n.\nCan you explain why this\nformula is correct? Formulas for fixed-payment loans are more\ncomplicated.\n•\nThe terms of loans can be modified to suit particular clients\nand situations. It is possible to accelerate or delay the\nrepayment of the principal outstanding, either by design, or on\na contingent basis (if certain events occur). An amortization\ntable derived from the terms of the loan can then be\nconstructed.","metadata":{"source":"docs/AEM_2241/20230905 AEM 2241 Discounted Cash Flow Valuation III HANDOUT.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"LaTeX with Beamer class","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.24","CreationDate":"D:20230905012710-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20230905012710-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":12},"loc":{"pageNumber":3,"lines":{"from":1,"to":74}}}},{"pageContent":"Loan Types\nFixed, 25%, 5yrs\nFixed, 10%, 5yrs\nFixed, 10%, 30yrs\nVar, 25%, 5yrs\nVar, 10%, 5yrs\nVar, 10%, 30yrs\nTable: Fixed Payments, Short Maturity, High Interest\nr\n25.00%\nC\n37,184.67\nt\n5\nTotal int:\n85,923.37\nPV\n100,000.00\nPeriod  Beg.
