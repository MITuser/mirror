First, rather\nthan  expressing  preferences  simply  as  binary  “acceptable-or-not”  choices,  we  allow  each\nindividual to express\nhow much\nthey’d like each object, in numerical form.  In our example\nof students and dorm rooms from Section 10.1,  suppose that rather than specifying a list\nof acceptable rooms, each student provides a numerical score for each room, indicating how\nhappy they’d be with it.  We will refer to these numbers as the students’\nvaluations\nfor the\nrespective rooms.  Figure 10.3(a) shows an example of this with three students and three\nrooms;  for  instance,  Xin’s  valuations  for  Rooms  1,  2,  and  3  are  12,  2,  and  4  respectively\n(while Yoram’s valuations for Rooms 1, 2, and 3 are 8, 7, and 6 respectively).  Notice that\nstudents may disagree on which rooms are better, and by how much.","loc.pageNumber":296,"pdf.totalPages":833},{"text":"Following the values\nq\nn\nto a limit.\nIf we define the function\nf\n(\nx\n) = 1\n−\n(1\n−\npx\n)\nk\n, then\nwe can write Equation (21.6) as follows:\nq\nn\n=\nf\n(\nq\nn\n−\n1\n)\n.\nThis suggests a very clean, purely\nalgebraic way of formulating our question about\nq\n∗\n.
