Time will be announced and marked on the board.\n \nYou may use only a writing utensil and paper. If you use any electronic device for any purpose \nwe will immediately confiscate your exam paper. All calculations have been constructed so that \nyou will not need a calculator.\n \n \nWrite answers only in the assigne\nd space on the answer sheet. When you are done, we will collect \nyour answer sheet ONLY. Graders will see the segment of the answer sheet allocated for each \nproblem and nothing else.\n \n \nMake sure your name and netid are clearly written on every page of the an\nswer sheet, as we will \nremove staples to scan it.\n \n \nThe answer sheet is intended to provide more than enough space; don’t worry if you don’t fill it. \nShowing your work may allow us to give you partial credit. Do not spend more than 10 minutes \non a problem. \nIf you get stuck, move on and come back later.\n \n \nRaise your hand if you would like to ask a clarifying question.\n \nGood luck!","metadata":{"source":"docs/INFO_2950/INFO2950_FA22_MidtermQuestions.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"CloudConvert","Producer":"CloudConvert","CreationDate":"D:20231001045142+02'00'","ModDate":"D:20231001045142+02'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"CloudConvert","xmp:createdate":"2023-10-01T04:51:42+02:00","xmp:creatortool":"Microsoft® Word 2021","xmp:modifydate":"2023-10-01T04:51:42+02:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:7A335B4B-D1AB-43BF-AB5E-42696DC016F0","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:7A335B4B-D1AB-43BF-AB5E-42696DC016F0"}},"totalPages":8},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":1,"to":41}}}},{"pageContent":"2\n \nA.
