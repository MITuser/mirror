The chapter explores various aspects of voting systems, individual preferences, and the challenges associated with producing a single ranking from conflicting opinions. It also delves into topics such as majority rule, positional voting, Arrows Impossibility Theorem, single-peaked preferences, and more.\n\nHere are five quotations from Chapter 23:\n\n1. Unlike the case in Chapter 16, all the votes in our current analysis are being made simultaneously: no voter is able to see the decisions made by any other voter before reaching her own decision. (Page 756, Source: 23.7)\n2. The goal of a voting system, for our purposes, can be described as follows. A group of people is evaluating a finite set of possible alternatives; these alternatives could correspond to political candidates, possible verdicts in a trial, amounts of money to spend on national defense, nominees for an award, or any other set of options in a decision. (Page 737, Source: 23.2)\n3. The notion of voting encompasses a broad class of methods for reaching a group decision. For example, the methods to reach a jury verdict, an outcome in a U.S. Presidential Election, or a winner of college football’s Heisman Trophy are all distinct, and these distinctions have effects both on the process and the result. (Page 748, Source: 23.5)\n4. Examples from U.S. Presidential Elections. Versions of these pathologies are familiar from U.S. Presidential elections as well. The full Presidential Election process in the United States has a complex specification, but if we think about how states choose their electors in the general election — i.e. how they choose which candidate will receive the state’s electoral votes — it is generally done using plurality voting: the candidate who is top-ranked by the most voters wins. (Page 772, Source: Examples from U.S. Presidential Elections)\n5. In this chapter, we discussed how voting systems based on majority rule are susceptible to strategic agenda-setting. Let’s explore how one might do this on some basic examples.
