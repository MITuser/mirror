The fields are\nyoung, and expected to produce over the long term. A lot of the\npipeline capacity is tied up by long-term, favorable contracts. Now\nconsider a second division that engages in oil prospecting, often in\nregions not known for existing oil production. Clearly, the former\ndivision is much less risky than the latter, and the divisional WACC\nrates should reflect this.","metadata":{"source":"docs/AEM_2241/20231120 AEM 2241 Cost of Capital - HANDOUT.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"LaTeX with Beamer class","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.24","CreationDate":"D:20231121002009-05'00'","ModDate":"D:20231121002009-05'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":17},"loc":{"pageNumber":13,"lines":{"from":1,"to":61}}}},{"pageContent":"Cost of Capital\nEquity\nDebt\nWACC\nTo Do!\nWACC and the Pure Play Approach\n•\nDivisions within a large firm often specialize in a small(er)\nnumber of relatively homogeneous activities/projects within\nthe larger firm.\n•\nWhenever this is true, the divisional WACC may be estimated\nby finding independent firms whose activity profile\napproximates well that of the division under consideration.\n•\nIf the independent firm’s equity and debt trades publicly, then\nthen WACC can be computed for the “analogous” firm, and\ncan then be attributed, perhaps with some adjustments, to\nthe division.\n•\nIn an idealized setting, both the division and the analogous\nfirm would engage in one type of activity.

Such projects must be\nundertaken irrespective of costs and profitability, so a\nWACC-type approach is not suitable for their analysis.","metadata":{"source":"docs/AEM_2241/20231120 AEM 2241 Cost of Capital - HANDOUT.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"LaTeX with Beamer class","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.24","CreationDate":"D:20231121002009-05'00'","ModDate":"D:20231121002009-05'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":17},"loc":{"pageNumber":14,"lines":{"from":1,"to":45}}}},{"pageContent":"Cost of Capital\nEquity\nDebt\nWACC\nTo Do!\nExample: Subjective Approach\n•\nAssume that a firm’s WACC is 14%.\n•\nThe firm may develop the following subjective approach to\nadjust WACC to account for its projects’ riskiness:\nCategory    Example\nWACC Adjustment  Project WACC\nHigh risk\nNew products or markets\n+6%\n20%\nMedium risk  Cost savings, expansion of existing lines\n+0%\n14%\nLow risk\nEquipment replacement\n-4%\n10%\nMandatory    Pollution control\nN/A\nN/A\nCost of Capital\nEquity\nDebt\nWACC\nTo Do!\nWACC and Company Valuation\n•\nInterest on debt is a financing cost, not an operating cost.
