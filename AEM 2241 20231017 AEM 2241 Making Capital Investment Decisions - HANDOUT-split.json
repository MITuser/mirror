It spreads the initial cost of the\ncapital asset over the asset’s\nlegally-defined\nuseful economic\nlife. Ultimately, the most important role of depreciation is the\nreduction in tax that it generates.\n•\nFrom our perspective, the cash flow related to the initial\npurchase of the asset is relevant. Depreciation is relevant only\nto the extent it reduces the tax expense, thus indirectly\ncontributing to an increase in cash flows.\n•\nTo stimulate investments, tax law generally favors aggressive\n(fast) depreciation schedules.\n•\nThe most important system for computing depreciation is the\nmodified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS).

From an accounting and tax\nperspective, these costs are spread out over the length of\nuseful economic life. From a cash flow perspective, however,\nall that matters is when “cash moves.”\n•\nWhile an asset depreciates from an accounting and tax\nperspective, it also loses value. Ideally, the depreciated value\nand the true economic value would be close. Establishing true\neconomic value can be both labor-intensive (and thus\nexpensive and slow) and subject to manipulation.\n•\nTo simplify the process, depreciation schedules are defined by\nlaws and regulations.","metadata":{"source":"docs/AEM_2241/20231017 AEM 2241 Making Capital Investment Decisions - HANDOUT.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"LaTeX with Beamer class","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.24","CreationDate":"D:20231017004439-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20231017004439-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":9,"lines":{"from":1,"to":51}}}},{"pageContent":"Cash Flows\nPro-Forma\nOCF\nDCF\nTo Do!\nMACRS\n•\nThe Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)\nhas been in use in the US since 1981.\n•\nEach asset is classified into one of several categories.
