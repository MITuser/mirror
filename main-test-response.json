This theorem is based on the assumption of single-peaked preferences, meaning that each voter has an ideal outcome and their preference decreases as they move away from this ideal point.\n\nThe theorem is explained in detail in the section titled Single-Peaked Preferences and the Median Voter Theorem in Chapter 23 of the context provided. The theorem is introduced on page 754, where it is stated that With single-peaked rankings, the median individual favorite defeats every other alternative in a pairwise majority vote.\n\nThe theorem is further explained through an example on page 758, where the process of identifying the median individual favorite and building up the group ranking is illustrated. \n\nThe theorem is based on the observation that the median individual favorite can always gather a majority of support against any other alternative because for more than half the voters, the median lies between the other alternative and each of their respective favorites.\n\nIn essence, the Median Voter Theorem suggests that the median voters preference will be the most influential in determining the outcome of a vote, given that preferences are single-peaked. This theorem is a fundamental concept in understanding voting behavior and the dynamics of democratic decision-making.","sourceDocuments":[{"text":"certain forms of undesirable behavior.
