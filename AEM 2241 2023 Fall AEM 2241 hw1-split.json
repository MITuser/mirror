[{"pageContent":"AEM 2241\nFinance\nTibor Jánosi\nSpring 2023\nHomework 1\nSolutions\nAs explained in class, it is a good idea to set your calculator to use\nhigher precision\nwhen\ncomputing results on a homework or exam question. Generally, setting your computer to use\na 4 or 5-decimal precision will be more than enough. It is especially important for you to use\nhigh precision if you will be writing down intermediate results. Changing your precision setting\nwas demonstrated in class.\nYou can also\nstore and recall intermediate results\nby using the STO X and RCL X\nkey combinations, where X is a digit from 0 to 9. This allows you access to the calculator’s 10\nmemory registers. Additionally, X can also be one of the TVM buttons: N, I/Y, PV, PMT,\nFV when used in combination with RCL. This functionality; also demonstrated in class, can\nbe used to avoid writing down intermediate results altogether.\nIn the solutions below\nwe typically show the value stored in the PMT register, eve\nif it is 0\n. As you know, when you clear the TVM registers, PMT is set to 0. To eliminate\nambiguities, however, consistent with in-class practice, we set the PMT to 0 explicitly.\nWe do not present all possible solutions to all problems.  Sometimes we present both a\nformula-based and a calculator-based solution, sometimes we present only one of them.\nWe\nencourage you to practice by solving the problems below by also using the method\nthat we did not present explicitly\n.\nWhen setting up problems for the calculator, it is critical to keep track of cash flow signs\nwhen solving problems with the calculator. If you have present values, payments, and future\nvalues, consistency is especially important. However, unless we explicitly request it, we do not\nask for signed cash flow amounts\nas results\nfor answers to homework or exam problems\nif the\ncontext makes clear the direction of the cash flow\n.
