In\nsome cases, we were able to come up with precise predictions about prices and power, but\nin others the analysis left open a range of possibilities.  For example, in the case of perfect\ncompetition between traders, we could conclude that the traders would make no profit, but\nit was not possible to say whether the resulting situation would favor particular buyers or\nsellers  —  different  divisions  of  the  available  surplus  were  possible.   This  is  an  instance  of\na  broader  phenomenon  that  we  discussed  earlier,  in  Chapter  6:  when  there  are  multiple\nequilibria, some of which favor one player and some of which favor another, we may need to\nlook for additional sources of information to predict how things will turn out.","loc.pageNumber":353,"pdf.totalPages":833},{"text":"settings (Chapters 16, 22, Sections 23.6-23.10); and the analysis of large-scale network data\nsets (Sections 2.3, 3.2-3.3, 3.6, 4.4, 5.3, 13.3-13.4, 14.2-14.5, 18.2, 18.5, 20.5).
