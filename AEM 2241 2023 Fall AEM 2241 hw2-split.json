[{"pageContent":"HADM 2250\nFinance\nTibor Jánosi\nFall 2023\nHomework 2\nSolutions\nAs explained in class, it is a good idea to set your calculator to use\nhigher precision\nwhen\ncomputing results on a homework or exam question. Generally, setting your computer to use\na 4 or 5-decimal precision will be more than enough. It is especially important for you to use\nhigh precision if you will be writing down intermediate results. Changing your precision setting\nwas demonstrated in class.\nYou can also\nstore and recall intermediate results\nby using the STO X and RCL X\nkey combinations, where X is a digit from 0 to 9. This allows you access to the calculator’s 10\nmemory registers. Additionally, X can also be one of the TVM buttons: N, I/Y, PV, PMT,\nFV when used in combination with RCL. This functionality; also demonstrated in class, can\nbe used to avoid writing down intermediate results altogether.\nIn the solutions below\nwe typically show the value stored in the PMT register, eve\nif it is 0\n. As you know, when you clear the TVM registers, PMT is set to 0. To eliminate\nambiguities, however, consistent with in-class practice, we set the PMT to 0 explicitly.\nWe do not present all possible solutions to all problems.  Sometimes we present both a\nformula-based and a calculator-based solution, sometimes we present only one of them.\nWe\nencourage you to practice by solving the problems below by also using the method\nthat we did not present explicitly\n.\nWhen setting up problems for the calculator, it is critical to keep track of cash flow signs\nwhen solving problems with the calculator. If you have present values, payments, and future\nvalues, consistency is especially important. However, unless we explicitly request it, we do not\nask for signed cash flow amounts\nas results\nfor answers to homework or exam problems\nif the\ncontext makes clear the direction of the cash flow\n.

One\nannuity pays $2,500 on the first day of each year for 15 years. How much does the second\nannuity pay each year for 15 years if it pays at the end of each year?\nSolution\n:\nWe compute the PV of the\nannuity due\nusing the calculator.

Press CPT PMT to get\n2,681.25.\nSo the annuity pays $2,681.25 every period.\n2  Problem 2\nYou just acquired a home mortgage for 30 years in the amount of $184,500 at 4.65 percent\ninterest compounded monthly. How much of the first payment will be interest if the loan is\nrepaid in equal monthly payments?\nSolution\n:\nThe BB for the first month is the actual amount of the loan, so BB = $184,500. The monthly\ninterest rate is\nr\n=\n4\n.\n65\n12\n= 0\n.\n3875%\n. The amount of interest is\nBB\n·\nr\n= 184\n,\n500\n·\n0\n.\n003875 =\n$714\n.\n94\n. We do not need to compute the monthly payment to answer this question!\nThis is a constant-payment loan - effectively, an annuity.

The yield to maturity is 7.6 percent and the bond matures in 20 years.

But the payments (coupons) are annual, so there is only one payment per\nyear.\nWe use the calculator: N = 20, I/Y = 7.6, PMT = 128.00, FV = 2,000. CPT PV yields\n-1,757.18.

The bond has a par value of $1,000 and\na yield to maturity of 6.96 percent. What is the bond’s coupon rate?\nSolution\n:\nThe bond has a par value of $1,000. The bond trades at par when its price is equal to its\nface value (or principal). So P = $1,000. As seen here, sometimes the face value is also called\n“par value.”\nThe per-period yield is\n6\n.\n96%\n2\n= 3\n.\n48%\n.  How do we know?  The bond pays semi-annual\ncoupons.\nWe use the calculator: N = 44 (\n22\n·\n2)\n, I/Y = 3.48%, PV = -965.18, FV = 1,000. We press\nCPT PMT and we get 33.2425. This is the semi-annual coupon.
