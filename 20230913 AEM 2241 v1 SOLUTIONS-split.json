Some of these problems are more complex that the problems you may be expected to solve\nduring the exam. Nevertheless, you should attempt to solve them as\nsub-parts\nof more complex\nquestions may be posed as exam questions. You will benefit most if you work on these problems\nbefore you look at the solutions. The course staff can answer any questions that you may have\nin relation to these problems.\n1.2. The problem set is issued before all the material testable on the exam was taught. It may happen\nthat some topics may not have been covered (yet) in class before the exam. If so, just skip the\nrelevant parts.\n1.3. All assumptions, conventions, and notations that we normally use can be relied without further\nexplanations. If you use non-standard notations, explain what they mean.\n1.4. Unless stated otherwise, we ask that dollar amounts be rounded to two decimals, and interest rates\nbe rounded to four decimals. For example: $156,798.38, $9.75, 0.0315 = 3.15%, 0.1425=14.25%.\n1.5. Be careful to distinguish between per-period quantities, such as per-period coupon payments and\ninterest rates, and their annualized versions, which are the ones that must be typically provided\nas results.\n1.6. [When working on paper] Unless we tell you otherwise, you may use either formulas or financial\ncalculators to solve a problem. Whether you are using formulas or calculators, you must show\nwhat you did (e.g. what formulas you used, what values you replaced, or what calculator buttons\nyou pushed and what values you entered), and\nyou must briefly explain the logic of your\nsolutions\n.\n1.7. [When working on paper] To eliminate any possible ambiguity, whenever using the calculator,\nyou must indicate values for all 5 TVM buttons; except for the value that you compute.

You are guaranteed an\ninterest rate of 7.5% per annum for 10 years, compounded annually. We say that two interest rates are\nequivalent over a given time horizon\nt\nif the total interest earned by time t is the same in both cases.\n3.1. Given a time horizon of\nt\n= 5\nyears, what is the simple interest rate that is equivalent to the\ncompound interest rate described above?\n3.2. Given a time horizon of\nt\n= 10\nyears, what is the simple interest rate that is equivalent to the\ncompound interest rate described above?\n3.3. Do the answers to the two questions above depend on your initial investment, assuming that the\nterms of the investment remain otherwise the same? Why?\n3.4.

Thus if the simple\ninterest rate is\nr\ns\n,\nthe annual interest earned is always\nP V\n·\nr\ns\n. Over\nt\ntime periods, we earn\nP V\n·\nr\ns\n·\nt\ntotal interest. We equate the two quantities:\nT I\n=\nP V\n·\n\u0002\n(1 +\nr\n)\nt\n−\n1\n\u0003\n=\nP V\n·\nr\ns\n·\nt\n.

If the compound interest rate is 0, then we immediately get that\nr\ns\n= 0\n,\nand the answer does\nnot depend on the period\nt\n.

We can rewrite the inequality by moving two\ndiscount factors from one side to the other side:\nf\n3\n−\nf\n4\n−\n(\nf\n2\n−\nf\n3\n)\n<\n0\n, which then becomes\n2\n·\nf\n3\n−\nf\n2\n−\nf\n4\n<\n0\n.\nFor the first two payments of the old contract, the change in value from moving them both to 9\nmonths is\nC\noriginal\n·\n(\nf\n3\n−\nf\n2\n)+\nC\noriginal\n·\n(\nf\n3\n−\nf\n4\n)\n, which is equal to\nC\noriginal\n·\n(\nf\n3\n−\nf\n2\n+\nf\n3\n−\nf\n4\n) =\nC\noriginal\n·\n(2\n·\nf\n3\n−\nf\n2\n−\nf\n4\n)\n<\n0\n.\nNow, the same intuition holds for the pair of payments originally scheduled for payout at 18 and\n24 months, respectively, which are both moved to a payout date of 21 months.

Indeed, early in the day, 10-year Treasury yields\nwere as low as 1.18%, corresponding to a price of $1,029.50 per $1,000 face value. Typical Treasury\nbonds pay semi-annual coupons.\n16.1.

If yes, state what this lower bound is, and\nhow you know it is correct. A trivial lower bound of 0 is not an acceptable answer.\nSolution:\nWe know that when the yearly coupon is equal numerically to the bond’s (annualized) yield,\nthe bond trades at par, no matter what the compounding period is. To trade at par, the yearly\ncoupon would have to be 1.18%. The bond trades above par. Given that the face value and yield\nare fixed, the increase of the price (payment present value) above par must come from coupons\nthat are higher than 1.18% per year.\n16.2.

The yield of the bond is 4.7% per annum;\nfurther, you may assume that per-period rates are constant (they do not depend on the time horizon).\nThe bond contract includes covenants (agreements) meant to protect bond investors’ interest. In\nthe recent past the company breached one of these covenants. Even though some improvements did\noccur since then, the breach is expected to persist for the next two years, after which it is expected to\nbe cured (eliminated). While the breach persists, the coupon rate will be double the normal (stated)\none. If default were to occur, such an accelerated payment schedule assures that investors get more of\ntheir money back; if default does not occur, then the increased coupons act as a penalty for the breach\nof the covenant.\n17.1. Decompose this bond into simpler financial instruments that were studied in class.

These coupon payments exceed the face value of the bond, and, but\nfor the last one, all of them are paid earlier than the face value. Thus the cumulative net present value\nof the coupons must exceed the net present value of the face value, which means that more than half\nof the bond’s value comes from coupons. This conclusion is even stronger if coupon rates are higher.\nIn other words, the longer the maturity of the bond, and the higher the coupons, the more likely it is\nthat the statement above is false.\nThere are bonds for which the majority of the value comes from the principal payment, an obvious\nexample being zero-coupon bonds.

We do know, however, that all coupon payment dates for\nall these bonds are the same; the coupons, of course, are not. The bond in the middle is a so-called\ncallable bond, while the other two are regular Treasuries.\n24.1. Read the textbook and/or research the web to understand what callable Treasuries are. Sum-\nmarize your findings in a\nbrief\nparagraph.\nSolution:\nA callable bond may be redeemed (“recalled”) by its issuers under terms that were set before\nthe bond was first sold. Often, the recalled bond will be redeemed for its face value. In principle,\nany type of bond can be made callable. Callable Treasury bonds have historically been very rare;\nsome source may even indicate that they did not exist, but that is inaccurate.\n24.2.

In other\nwords, when would the callable Treasury be called and by whom?\nHint: Assume that the call decision is rational; consider changes in interest rate levels as time\npasses.\nSolution:\nIf a bond issuer acts rationally, a callable bond would be recalled only if the issuer benefits\nfrom this action. This means that a bond will be retired only if the NPV of the bond payments\nstill due are larger than the immediate redemption costs (face value, if we ignore administrative\nand other costs) of the bond.
