In this case the yearly payment is\nalways different.

In this case the\nloan runs for, say, 5 years, but is calculated to amortize over, say,\n$15 years (a longer period). At the end of the loan period (5 years),\nthe borrower repays the then-outstanding loan balance, or, very\ncommonly, refinances the loan.\nLast updated on August 30, 2023.","metadata":{"source":"docs/AEM_2241/20230830 AEM 2241 Discounted Cash Flow Valuation II HANDOUT.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"LaTeX with Beamer class","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.24","CreationDate":"D:20230830231313-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20230830231313-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":6},"loc":{"pageNumber":6,"lines":{"from":1,"to":281}}}}]
