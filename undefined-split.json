The outcome in which you and your partner both study\nfor the exam is not Pareto-optimal,  since the outcome in which you both prepare for the\npresentation is strictly better for both of you.  This is the central difficulty at the heart of\nthis example,  now phrased in terms of Pareto-optimality.  It shows that even though you\nand your partner realize there is a superior solution, there is no way to maintain it without\na binding agreement between the two of you.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jun\\Coding\\CornellGPT\\docs\\1\\book-1.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"TeX","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.9","CreationDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":833},"loc":{"pageNumber":199,"lines":{"from":1,"to":12}}}},{"pageContent":"and your partner realize there is a superior solution, there is no way to maintain it without\na binding agreement between the two of you.\nIn  this  example,  the  two  outcomes  in  which  exactly  one  of  you  prepares  for  the  pre-\nsentation are also Pareto-optimal.

By  revisiting  the  analysis  we’ve  used  thus  far,  and  adapting  it  a  little\nbit, one can show that if there is no augmenting path beginning at\nany\nnode on the right-\nhand side, then in fact the current matching has maximum size.  This shows that if, as we\nprogress through larger and larger matchings, we always search for an augmenting path from\nevery node on the right-hand side, then either one of these searches will succeed, or else we\ncan conclude that the current matching has maximum size.

So stable outcomes are also able to pick\nup on the subtlety that the central node\nC\non the 5-node path is in fact very weak.\nNow we know that in fact human subjects on the 3-node path or 5-node paths will not\npush things all the way to 0-1 outcomes;  rather,  the powerful nodes tend to get amounts\nmore like\n5\n6\n.  But our discussion surrounding the Ultimatum Game shows that this is, in a\nsense, the most extreme kind of outcome that we’ll see from real people.  Since the notion\nof stability isn’t designed to avoid extremes, we’ll view this mismatch between theory and\nexperiment  as  something  that  is  relatively  easy  to  explain  and  account  for:  when  we  see\nstrong-power outcomes in practice like\n1\n6\n-\n5\n6","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jun\\Coding\\CornellGPT\\docs\\1\\book-1.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"TeX","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.9","CreationDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":833},"loc":{"pageNumber":371,"lines":{"from":1,"to":29}}}},{"pageContent":"experiment  as  something  that  is  relatively  easy  to  explain  and  account  for:  when  we  see\nstrong-power outcomes in practice like\n1\n6\n-\n5\n6\n, we can think of this as being as close to 0-1 as\nhuman players will get.\n1\nOur  current  framework  is  also  good  at  identifying  situations  where  there  is  no  stable\noutcome.

The social-networking aspects of Web 2.0\nsites provide rich data for large-studies of social network structure, as discussed in Chapter 2.\nThey offer a basis for empirical studies of the ideas of triadic closure and group affiliation from\nChapters 3 and 4, and have been used to evaluate the theories underlying the small-world\nphenomenon in Chapter 20.\nMoreover,  many of the features that are common to Web 2.0 sites are designed to ex-","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jun\\Coding\\CornellGPT\\docs\\1\\book-1.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"TeX","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.9","CreationDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":833},"loc":{"pageNumber":408,"lines":{"from":1,"to":15}}}},{"pageContent":"Chapters 3 and 4, and have been used to evaluate the theories underlying the small-world\nphenomenon in Chapter 20.\nMoreover,  many of the features that are common to Web 2.0 sites are designed to ex-\nplicitly steer some of the underlying social feedback mechanisms in desirable directions.

Indeed, as we will see in this chapter,\nmuch of the richness of the theory of voting comes from precisely this attempt to combine\npreferences in the absence of simple metaphors like averaging.\nThe notion of voting encompasses a broad class of methods for reaching a group decision.\nFor example, the methods to reach a jury verdict, an outcome in a U.S. Presidential Election,\nor a winner of college football’s Heisman Trophy are all distinct, and these distinctions have\neffects both on the process and the result.

Hence you should\ntake this into account when bidding,  and bid lower than your estimate of the true value.\nThis type of insincerity in bidding is analogous to the insincerity in voting that we’ve been\ndiscussing here; in both cases, they arise because you’re evaluating your decision contingent\non its actually affecting the outcome,  which provides additional implicit information that\nneeds to be taken into account.\n23.9    Jury Decisions and the Unanimity Rule\nJury decisions in criminal trials were an important initial example to motivate this discussion:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jun\\Coding\\CornellGPT\\docs\\1\\book-1.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"TeX","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.9","CreationDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20100610141943-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":833},"loc":{"pageNumber":775,"lines":{"from":1,"to":13}}}},{"pageContent":"needs to be taken into account.\n23.9    Jury Decisions and the Unanimity Rule\nJury decisions in criminal trials were an important initial example to motivate this discussion:\nthey form a natural class of instances where a group of voters (the jurors) agree in principle\nthat there is a “best” decision for the group — the defendant should be convicted if guilty and\nacquitted if innocent — and they want to aggregate their individual opinions to try arriving\nat this best decision.
