Some of these problems are more complex that the problems you may be expected to solve\nduring the exam. Nevertheless, you should attempt to solve them as\nsub-parts\nof more complex\nquestions may be posed as exam questions. You will benefit most if you work on these problems\nbefore you look at the solutions. The course staff can answer any questions that you may have\nin relation to these problems.\n1.2. The problem set is issued before all the material testable on the exam was taught. It may happen\nthat some topics may not have been covered (yet) in class before the exam. If so, just skip the\nrelevant parts.\n1.3. All assumptions, conventions, and notations that we normally use can be relied without further\nexplanations. If you use non-standard notations, explain what they mean.\n1.4. Unless stated otherwise, we ask that dollar amounts be rounded to two decimals, and interest rates\nbe rounded to four decimals. For example: $156,798.38, $9.75, 0.0315 = 3.15%, 0.1425=14.25%.\n1.5. Be careful to distinguish between per-period quantities, such as per-period coupon payments and\ninterest rates, and their annualized versions, which are the ones that must be typically provided\nas results.\n1.6. [When working on paper] Unless we tell you otherwise, you may use either formulas or financial\ncalculators to solve a problem. Whether you are using formulas or calculators, you must show\nwhat you did (e.g. what formulas you used, what values you replaced, or what calculator buttons\nyou pushed and what values you entered), and\nyou must briefly explain the logic of your\nsolutions\n.\n1.7. [When working on paper] To eliminate any possible ambiguity, whenever using the calculator,\nyou must indicate values for all 5 TVM buttons; except for the value that you compute. Indicate\nexplicitly what buttons you pushed to get a result, and what the result is.","metadata":{"source":"docs/AEM_2241/20230913 AEM 2241 v1.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"LaTeX with hyperref","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.24","CreationDate":"D:20230913204224-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20230913204224-04'00'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":null,"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":1,"to":34}}}},{"pageContent":"explicitly what buttons you pushed to get a result, and what the result is.\n1.8.

Your first assignment is\nto value a corporate bond paying semi-annual coupons at an annual rate of 9.5%, with a maturity\nof exactly 2 years. The bond has a face value of $1,000. A senior analyst has already processed the\ncurrent Treasury price data and provided you with an up-to-date term structure chart, shown in Figure\n1. You are told to treat this corporate bond similarly to government bonds; i.e. you will ignore all\ndefault, liquidity, and similar risks, which will be analyzed by more experienced colleagues.\n20.1. The term structure of interest rates chart has a horizontal axis labeled “Maturity,” and a vertical\naxis labeled “[Annual\n1\n] Yield.” What kind of government bonds have their yields and maturities\nplotted on this chart?\n20.2. From earlier problems you solved while in college, you learned to decompose more complex\nfinancial instruments into sums - or differences - of simpler instruments. Explain how you can\ndecompose this corporate bond into a collection of zero-coupon bonds of different maturities,\nperhaps having atypical face values. Provide a brief statement explaining the decomposition and\nshow, in a table, what would be the bond’s maturities and face values, respectively.\n20.3. You learned that in realistic settings cash flows that arrive later must be discounted at (usually)\nhigher per-period interest rates. For each zero-coupon bond listed in part 20.2 above, use the\nterm-structure chart and look up its corresponding yield. Next, compute the present value of each\nzero-coupon bond. Using these zero-coupon bond prices, and also relying your earlier insights,\nprovide a computed (theoretical) price for your corporate bond.\n20.4. You now have a price for your corporate bond - what is its yield?\n20.5.

Similarly, we have seen atypical\nannuities described as sums or differences of regular annuities.

The bond in the middle is a so-called\ncallable bond, while the other two are regular Treasuries.\n24.1. Read the textbook and/or research the web to understand what callable Treasuries are.
